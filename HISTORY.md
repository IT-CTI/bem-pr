0.5.0 / 2013-12-03
==================

NOTE: this release breaks backward compability with previous versions

  * no more `<setName>.sets` levels needed, all building process are made
    in `<setName>.<tech>` direcotories, e.g. `desktop.examples` (#36)
  * teches are declared with `SetsNode#getSoutceTechs`
  * no more default teches declared â€” user should always use `getSoutceTechs`
    in `make.js` to specify sets' teches
  * all tests related stuff renamed to `specs` (#62)

    - tests -> specs
    - test.js -> spec.js
    - test-tmpl -> spec.bemjson.js
    - TestNode -> SpecNode

  * SpecNode in no longer inherits from ExampleNode, so
    `SpecNode#getTechs` and `SpecNode#getLevels` should be defined explicitly
  * default test's bundle is <spec-tech-name> instead of `default`,
    for example `desktop.specs/dom/spec-js`
  * bug fixed
